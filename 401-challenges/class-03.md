## Whiteboard Process

![whiteboard](/401-challenges/assets/whiteboard-03.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
- Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

**Big 0**
- Time -> O(n)
- Space -> O(h)
